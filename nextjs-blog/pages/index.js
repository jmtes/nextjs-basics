// LINKS
// In the h1, a Link component is used to wrap an a tag to allow for
// client-side navigation within the app.

// The page transition happens using JS, which is faster than the default
// navigation done by the browser.
// With client-side navigation, the broswer no longer has to load full
// pages, and thus perform complete refreshes, in between page transitions.

// Furthermore, Next.js does code splitting automatically, meaning each
// page only loads what's necessary for that page. When the homepage is
// rendered, the code for other pages is not served initially, which lets
// the homepage load quickly even if hundreds of pages are added.

// In a production build also, whenever Link components appear in the
// browser viewport, Next.js automatically prefetches the code for the
// linked page in the background, making page transitions near-instant.

// This code splitting also means that pages become isolated. If one page
// throws an error, the rest of the app should still work.

// Notes
// If you need to link to an external page, just use a regular <a> tag.
// If you need to add attributes like className, add them to the <a> tag,
// not the Link tag. The Link should only have an href attribute.

// For more, refer to the routing section of the Next.js docs.

// STATIC ASSETS
// Static files can be served under the top level public directory.

// Files inside of this directory can be referenced from the root of the
// app similarly to pages. Note how the logo image in the footer is referred.

// If you wanted to add a new asset /images/me.jpg, the file path would be
// public/images/me.jpg.

// For more, refer to the Static File Serving section of the Next.js docs.

// METADATA
// Head is a React component built into Next.js that allows you to modify
// the <head> metadata of a page. It's imported from the next/head module.

// For more, see the API reference for next/head.
// If you want to customize the <html> tag, you can do so by creating a
// pages/_document.js file. Learn more in the custom Document
// documentation.

// CSS STYLING
// Next.js has built-in support for Styled-JSX, which is what is used in
// this example. You can still use other popular CSS-in-JS libraries
// such as Styled-Components or Emotion, but they don't have support
// built-in.

// There's also built-in support for CSS (Modules) and SASS, which allows
// you to import CSS and SCSS files.

// Using CSS libraries like Tailwind CSS is also supported.

// You can use the classnames library to toggle classes.
// You can use SCSS/SASS via CSS Modules using the .module.scss or
// .module.sass extensions. Just be sure to install SASS first!

// For more, see the CSS section of the Next.js documentation.

// STATIC GENERATION
// Pages will be generated during build time and reused for each request.
// Can be done with or without data.

// Use static generation as opposed to server-side rendering whenever you
// can! As a rule of thumb you should only use server-side rendering if
// your page contains data that needs to be constantly updated or that
// changes on every request.

// STATIC GENERATION WITH DATA
// For some pages, you might not be able to render the HTML without fetching
// some external data first.
// You might need to access the file system, fetch from an external API,
// query your DB, etc. at build time.

// This is when getStaticProps comes in!
// It's an async function exported alongside a page component that runs at
// build time in production. Inside it you can fetch external data and
// return an object containing a `props` key, which, as you may be able to
// guess, will be passed to the page component as props.

// Essentially, getStaticProps tells Next.js, "Hey, this page has some data
// dependencies, so when you pre-render this page at build time, make sure
// to resolve them first!"

// See below for an example on how to use getStaticProps!

export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const allPostsData = getSortedPostsData();

  return { props: { allPostsData } };

  // Example to fetch from external API
  // Next.js polyfills fetch on both the client and server, so you don't
  // have to worry about importing it!
  const res = await fetch('..');
  return res.json();

  // You can do Prisma queries here too, I imagine!
  // getStaticProps only ever runs on the server-side, which means you can
  // write code sich as direct database queries without them being sent to
  // browsers!
  // Ooh, this means you can probably use this to use the Imgur API or
  // something without having to expose your key/token in the client-side
  // code!
};

// Note that, because getStaticProps is meant to be run at build time, you
// won't be able to use data that's only available during request time, such
// as query parameters or HTTP headers.

// It's also worth noting that getStaticProps can only be exported from a
// page (that is, a file under the top-level pages directory).

export default Home;
